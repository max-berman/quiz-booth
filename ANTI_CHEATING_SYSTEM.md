# Anti-Cheating System Implementation

## Problem Statement

The system was vulnerable to a cheating scenario where players could:

1. Play a game and get a score (e.g., 100)
2. Go directly to the same game URL and refresh
3. Start over knowing all answers to get a better score (e.g., 300)
4. Submit the higher score to the leaderboard

## Solution: First-Completion Lock System

Implemented a robust system that permanently locks the first completed score for each game session and prevents score overwriting.

### Key Components

#### 1. First-Completion Tracking (`client/src/lib/first-completion-utils.ts`)

**Features:**

- **Permanent Storage**: First completion data is stored permanently in localStorage
- **Tamper Detection**: Uses hash-based verification to detect data manipulation
- **Session Matching**: Tracks which session completed the game first
- **Locked Results**: Provides access to locked scores for display

**Key Functions:**

- `saveFirstCompletion()` - Saves first completion data (can only be set once)
- `hasFirstCompletion()` - Checks if first completion exists
- `getLockedResults()` - Retrieves locked score for display
- `isFirstCompletion()` - Determines if current session is the first completion

#### 2. Enhanced Session Management (`client/src/hooks/use-game-session.ts`)

**Modifications:**

- Automatically saves first completion data when game is completed
- Prevents multiple first completion saves
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing session system

#### 3. Game Flow Protection (`client/src/pages/game.tsx`)

**Security Measures:**

- **Automatic Redirection**: If game was already completed, redirects to results page
- **Session Validation**: Checks if current session matches first completion session
- **Prevents Replay**: Blocks new game sessions for completed games

#### 4. Results Page Enhancement (`client/src/pages/results.tsx`)

**UI Improvements:**

- **Score Locked Banner**: Clear visual indication when score is locked
- **Lock Icon**: Visual lock indicator on the score display
- **Submission Prevention**: Prevents score submission for locked/replayed games
- **Contextual Messaging**: Different messages for first completion vs replayed games

#### 5. Server-Side Reinforcement (`firebase-functions/src/games/games.ts`)

**Additional Security:**

- **Enhanced Logging**: Logs all score submission attempts for monitoring
- **Score Validation**: Existing validation system remains active
- **Future Enhancement**: Ready for player history tracking

## How It Works

### Normal Game Flow (First Completion)

1. Player completes game → Results saved to session storage
2. First completion data saved permanently to localStorage
3. Player can submit score to leaderboard
4. Score is now locked for this game

### Cheating Prevention Flow (Replay Attempt)

1. Player tries to access completed game → Redirected to results page
2. Results page shows locked score from first completion
3. Score submission is disabled
4. Clear messaging explains the score is locked

### Technical Implementation

#### Storage Keys

- `quizbooth_game_session_${gameId}` - Temporary session data (24h expiry)
- `quizbooth_game_results_${gameId}` - Temporary results (5m expiry)
- `quizbooth_first_completion_${gameId}` - Permanent first completion data
- `quizbooth_submission_${gameId}` - Submission tracking

#### Data Structure

```typescript
interface FirstCompletionData {
	score: number
	correctAnswers: number
	totalQuestions: number
	timeSpent: number
	streak: number
	gameId: string
	sessionId: string
	completedAt: number
	submissionHash: string // Tamper detection
}
```

#### Security Features

1. **Hash Verification**: Prevents localStorage data tampering
2. **Session Matching**: Ensures only the original session can access first completion
3. **Permanent Lock**: First completion cannot be overwritten
4. **UI Transparency**: Clear indication of locked status to users

## User Experience

### For Honest Players

- No change to normal gameplay
- Clear indication when score is locked after first completion
- Ability to play again for fun (score not saved)

### For Cheating Attempts

- Automatic redirection to results page
- Locked score display prevents score improvement
- Clear messaging about score preservation
- No ability to submit improved scores

## Testing the System

### Development Testing

1. Complete a game normally and submit score
2. Try to access the same game URL directly
3. Verify redirection to results page with locked score
4. Confirm score submission is disabled

### Production Considerations

- Backward compatible with existing games
- No data migration required
- Gradual rollout possible

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Player History**: Track multiple attempts for analytics
2. **IP/Fingerprint Tracking**: Additional anti-cheating measures
3. **Time-Based Restrictions**: Prevent rapid reattempts
4. **Server-Side Validation**: Enhanced score consistency checks

### Monitoring

- Console logs for debugging in development
- Server-side logging for suspicious patterns
- Analytics tracking for replay attempts

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/lib/first-completion-utils.ts` - New utility functions
2. `client/src/hooks/use-game-session.ts` - Enhanced session management
3. `client/src/pages/game.tsx` - Added completion check and redirection
4. `client/src/pages/results.tsx` - Enhanced UI with locked score display
5. `firebase-functions/src/games/games.ts` - Added server-side logging

## Conclusion

The anti-cheating system effectively prevents the identified vulnerability by:

- **Locking first completion scores permanently**
- **Preventing game replay for score improvement**
- **Providing clear user feedback about locked scores**
- **Maintaining existing functionality for honest players**

The system is robust, user-friendly, and ready for production deployment.
